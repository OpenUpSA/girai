         Executive Summary

         Background
         The Global Index on Responsible AI (GIRAI) is the first tool to set globally-relevant benchmarks
         for responsible AI and assess them in countries around the world. This study constitutes the
         largest global data collection on responsible AI to-date. In its first edition, the Global Index on
         Responsible AI covers 138 countries and jurisdictions, including 41 countries from Africa.




         Defining Responsible AI

         Responsible AI refers to the design, development, deployment and governance of AI in a way
         that respects and protects all human rights and upholds the principles of AI ethics through
         every stage of the AI lifecycle and value chain. It requires all actors involved in the national AI
         ecosystem to take responsibility for the human, social and environmental impacts of their
         decisions.




         The responsible design, deployment and governance of AI are proportionate to the purpose of
         its use and meet the technological needs of the individuals and societies it seeks to serve.

        Measuring Responsible AI

       The Global Index on Responsible AI measures 19 thematic areas of responsible AI, which are

       clustered into 3 dimensions: Human Rights and AI, Responsible AI Governance and

       Responsible AI Capacities. Each thematic area assesses the performance of 3 different

       pillars of the responsible AI ecosystem: Government frameworks, Government actions,

       and Non-state actors’ initiatives.

              Methodology and Scoring

              Data for the GIRAI was collected first-hand by 138 in-country

              researchers. Researchers completed a comprehensive expert

              survey containing 1862 questions (98 per thematic area)

              designed to ascertain what conditions were in place and

              what actions were being taken to advance responsible AI in

              each country surveyed, between November 2021 and

              November 2023. A global team of quality assessors

              conducted an exhaustive review of all data collected.






              GIRAI scores are derived from the primary data gathered

              across the three pillars. Each thematic area is scored on

              each pillar, scaled to a 0-100 range, and averaged to

              compute pillar scores. These are then adjusted using a

              coefficient built from secondary data for each country which

              accounts for the effectiveness of government frameworks,

              government actions, and the enabling environment for non-

              state actors. Each pillar is assigned a specific weight and

              aggregated into an overall score which allows a comparative

              assessment of efforts made by countries to promote

              responsible AI and to rank them accordingly.






              The countries included in the 1st Edition of the Global Index

              on Responsible AI were chosen based on where suitable

              country-researchers were recruited and the existing

              research network of institutional partners. Governments were

              not involved in determining whether their country was

              included in the Index.

         Key Findings

         The First Edition of the GlRAI revealed that global progress toward responsible AI is lagging
         far behind the development and adoption of AI. There are major gaps across many parts
         of the world and in many core areas of responsible AI, especially those areas related to

         Implications of the GIRAI for
         Advancing Responsible AI
         Three key insights were gleaned from the first Edition of the Global Index on Responsible
         AI about the adoption of responsible AI around the world and how to measure progress in
         this area

              Many efforts to promote responsible AI are embedded in broader government AI
              strategies which lack specific measures related to human rights considerations, such
              as gender equality. This trend highlights the need for comprehensive policies,
              recommendations, and guidelines based on human-centered approaches, with
              particular attention to human rights

              The measurement of responsible AI must take into account the responsibilities of
              actors across the entire AI lifecycle and ecosystems, including government actions
              beyond the setting of frameworks

              As international cooperation on responsible AI is an area of shared commitment
              between countries around the world, there is a key lever for strengthening the role of
              global communities in collaboratively monitoring responsible AI progress in practice.

              The Global Index on Responsible AI provides

              insights into the following questions:




                    1            What is the global state of responsible AI?




                                 What actions have countries taken to advance their commitment to

                   2             practicing responsible governance, use and development of AI?




                                 What are the evident regional and global trends emerging in relation to the
                   3             implementation - or lack thereof - of responsible AI standards?




                                 What are the major capacity gaps in advancing responsible AI
                   4             governance and practice around the world?




                                 What does and should responsible AI entail in different
                   5             regions of the world?




          The Global Index on Responsible AI will be published annually and will produce six further


          annual editions in anticipation of the global review of data related to the SDGs targets in


          2030. By establishing globally-representative measurement capabilities with which the


          relationship between responsible AI and the realization of the SDGs by 2030 can be tracked,


          the Global Index on Responsible AI aims to make a major contribution to the advancement of


          responsible AI around the world.

         What the Global Index on
         Responsible AI Measures
          Responsible AI is a systemic challenge that           GIRAI collects primary data based on
          cannot simply be met by creating frameworks           evidence within three pillars of the
          or appropriate AI products. Rather, Responsible       responsible AI ecosystem: Government
          AI emerges through an ecosystem that                  Frameworks, Government Actions, and
          encourages active engagement and continuous           Non-State Actors. In order to accurately
          dialogue among diverse stakeholders, including        measure the effectiveness of Government
          government officials, the private sector, and         Frameworks and Government Actions, as well
          various non-state actors such as academics            as the environment enabling Non-State
          and students who question conventional                Actors to operate independently at a national
          understandings of responsible AI.

          state actors within responsible AI ecosystems.



         The Global Index on Responsible AI does not measure:

             The degree to which AI systems are being designed and adopted in accordance with
             responsible AI standards
             The actions or impacts of big tech and AI companies in different parts of the world.
             The quality and performance of the identified Government Frameworks, Government actions
             and Non-state actors’ initiatives, using instead data on government actions as proxy metrics
             to assess the performance of government frameworks and selected secondary indicators.

         Scope of the Global Index on
         Responsible AI
          Any index is fundamentally constrained by the
          availability and accessibility of data. It is also
          subject to cultural and political biases that may
          result in an incomplete representation of
          specific dimensions and thematic areas.
          Carrying out a study of this scale required
          making decisions to ensure that the
          measurement framework was inclusive enough
          to accommodate the complexities and realities
          of as many countries as possible, yet specific
          enough to gauge the measurability of a new
          conceptual framework for responsible AI and to
          allow for a fair comparison between countries. 



          The data collected in the Global Index on
          Responsible AI relates to responsible AI
          activities from November 1, 2021 to November 1,
          2023, and therefore does not reflect the latest
          developments in responsible AI. Advancements
          that may have taken place between November
          2, 2023 and November 1, 2024 will be captured
          in the second edition of the Index.

 Responsible AI

 and AI Governance
 In examining the existence of government frameworks relating to responsible AI, the
 Global Index on Responsible AI found that while there are many examples and
 approaches to AI governance, the existence of frameworks governing AI does not
 necessarily mean that responsible AI is being promoted and advanced. In most of the
 countries surveyed, the national AI strategy is the main, if not the only, national
 government framework addressing AI. 39% of the countries assessed had national AI
 strategies in place to promote a country-level approach to AI development, use and
 governance. However, most of them lack enforceability, and few embed a broader range
 of responsible AI principles. As such, AI governance remains an idea rather than a
 concrete approach. Crucially, 79% of 34 countries scoring between 25 and 50 in the
 GIRAI have national AI strategies, but are far from demonstrating adequate capacity to
 ensure the responsible development and use of AI. 



 Countries that performed well in the Global Index on Responsible AI were able to
 demonstrate a wide range of governance mechanisms - including sector specific
 policies and legislative frameworks - to safeguard human rights and advance
 responsible AI development and use.

   Protecting

   Human Rights
   Responsible rights-preserving AI is the cornerstone for ensuring that AI does not
   exacerbate existing inequalities, within and between countries and groups, that it serves
   those who most need its benefits, that it prevents the emergence of new harms and
   exclusions associated with the rapid development and adoption of AI worldwide, and
   that it preserves individual freedoms and democratic values.2 However, the Global Index
   on Responsible AI found that few countries have mechanisms in place to protect human
   rights at risk from AI. Such mechanisms could include AI impact assessments to
   measure the real and potential harm of AI systems, access to redress and remedy
   where harm occurs, and public procurement guidelines that address the adoption of AI
   by the public sector which oftentimes includes the use of AI in the delivery of socio-
   economic rights and services to citizens.

Protecting Human Rights

   Only 43 of the countries assessed had government frameworks providing for the use of AI impact
   assessments and 35 had government frameworks providing for redress and remedy for rights
   violations and losses resulting from the use or development of AI. In the majority of countries,
   however, there were no clear procedures in place for seeking justice in the event of injury nor for
   investigating complaints, correcting errors or awarding compensation where appropriate. 



   Critically, while countries scoring above 75 in the Global Index on Responsible AI demonstrated high
   performance in relation to access to redress and remedy, this fell significantly for countries scoring
   below 75. For ensuring rights-respecting and responsible public use of AI through inclusive and
   sustainable public procurement processes, only 24 countries had government frameworks in place.

International
Cooperation in
Responsible AI
Across all regions, international cooperation was the highest scoring thematic area
demonstrating the foundations for global solidarity toward responsible AI. Indeed many
countries were able to demonstrate activity around international cooperation on
responsible AI. A significant finding is that the work of UNESCO constitutes the main
mechanism for building country-level capacity in responsible AI. Most countries scored
highly in the International Cooperation thematic area, citing their adoption of the UNESCO
Recommendation on Ethics in AI, and their commitment to supporting its implementation
tools. This shows the significance of UNESCO’s work in strengthening the capacity of
countries around the world to advance AI ethics and responsible AI. 



Another multilateral initiative cited was the Global Partnership on AI (GPAI), which currently
includes 29 country members from different regions of the world sharing the same
commitment to advancing responsible and rights-respecting AI use and development.
Regional activities toward responsible AI are also rising across the globe, such as the
Santiago Declaration in South and Central America and the Caribbean, that goes in line with
other regional approaches, such as the ASEAN Guide on AI Governance and Ethics. 



This foundational capacity observed within the global responsible AI ecosystem should be
leveraged to advance responsible AI around the world and bridge the AI divide.

Responsible AI
and Gender
Despite a growing awareness of the importance of gender equality in AI, it is concerning to
note that most countries have not yet made significant efforts to promote it. Gender
equality was one of the lowest performing thematic areas of the GIRAI. Only 24 of the
countries assessed had government frameworks addressing the intersection of gender and
AI. Nonetheless, 37 governments, including 6 in Africa, demonstrated evidence of initiatives
promoting gender equality in the context of AI. Significantly, in 67 countries, there was
involvement from at least one non-state actor dedicated to advancing gender equality in AI.
Civil society, followed by academic institutions, were the most active in this thematic area.
The GIRAI found evidence of 54 civil society-led initiatives on gender and AI, and 45
academic initiatives.

Responsible AI
and Inequality
The GIRAI found that in the majority of countries the conditions are not ripe for advancing
inclusive and equitable AI systems that benefit everyone. The thematic areas relating to the
rights of marginalized or underserved groups perform among the lowest, showing that few
governments consider inclusion and equity in AI to be a priority. 



In the review of the performance of the thematic areas within the Human Rights and AI
dimension we found that

    Commitment to gender equality decreases significantly as country scores on the Global
    Index on Responsible AI decreas
    Children’s rights are only properly considered by the top scoring countrie
    Bias and unfair discrimination is not a high performing thematic area in the top scoring
    countries relative to other thematic areas in thos
    Cultural and linguistic diversity is a low performing thematic area throughout the majority
    of the countries

In addition, the Global Index on Responsible AI reported that non-state actors, and
particularly civil society groups and academic institutions, were playing a crucial
role in pulling up performance in key thematic areas relating to equality and
inclusion, including: gender equality, labor protections and right to work, bias and
unfair discrimination and cultural and linguistic diversity, as shown in Figure 7.

The Global Index on Responsible AI found that few countries are ensuring that labor rights
are protected as AI use increases in the workplace, and as new AI-driven platforms and gig
economies emerge. Of the countries surveyed, 33 had a government framework for labor
protection and the right to work. Out of the 33 government frameworks addressing the right
to work and labor protection, only 7 are enforceable laws, while 26 are strategies, policies
and guidelines with limited enforceability. Importantly, efforts to ‘upskill’ workforces do not
correlate with sufficient labor protections for workers whose jobs might be at risk of
displacement from AI, and for those working in new AI-related industries. Figure 8 below
shows the relative role of non-state actors in advancing initiatives in this area and reflects
how the Middle East and Europe are at the forefront of regional efforts to address Labor
Protections and the Right to Work in the context of AI.

                                          The Portuguese Labor Code was amended in April 2023 to include a set of

                                          provisions relating to AI and worker protection. The first of these provisions

                                          allows for the conclusion of collective labor agreements in relation to AI use.

                                          The Code also foresees a right to equal treatment and non-discrimination for

                                          workers with regard to decisions based on algorithms. Finally, the Code

                                          provides for a special right for union representatives to be informed and have

    The government has promulgated Law 4961/2022, “Emerging information

    other provisions”, which addresses the use of AI in employment contexts,
    including hiring and evaluation, as well as digital platforms that contract
    workers. It provides that employers must carry out impact assessments for

   Diversity in AI
   The Global Index on Responsible AI measures the extent to which countries are addressing

   cultural and linguistic diversity as part of their efforts to promote responsible AI. The respect,

   promotion and advancement of cultural and linguistic diversity by responsible AI is essential to

   address some of the major cultural and linguistic imbalances in current AI models, particularly

   when it comes to large language models (LLMs). If used responsibly, AI can help promote

   diversity and protect low resourced languages and cultural heritage. AI applications spanning

   multiple language groups serve more people and promote inclusivity in AI.

   AI Safety
   The Global Index on Responsible AI revealed that only a very few
   number of countries have measures in place to ensure the
   safety, security, reliability and accuracy of AI systems. Given the
   globally interdependent nature of cyber systems and cyber
   security, as well as the growing number of cases of maleficent AI
   use3, this finding is deeply concerning. The technical integrity of
   AI on a global scale is not secure and at risk.

AI Safety

The GIRAI found that only 38 countries (representing 28% of the assessed
countries) have taken steps to address the safety, accuracy and reliability of AI
systems, and only 34 (25%) have government frameworks in place to enforce
technical safety and security standards for AI. In total only 36% of countries
reviewed had taken some kind of government-led activity, including frameworks or
actions, in relation to the safety, reliability and accuracy of AI systems. Figure 10
below shows the percentage of countries per region with some activity
throughout the pillars of the GIRAI.

   Responsible AI
   The Global Index on Responsible AI identified that universities and civil society
   organizations around the world are playing a pivotal role in advancing
   responsible AI within their countries. Universities take the lead in terms of non-
   state actors in almost all regions of the world, followed by civil society
   organizations. During the data collection for the GIRAI, more than 500 university
   and academic institutions worldwide were identified with activities toward
   responsible AI, along with over 400 civil society organizations and over 350
   private sector actors. In particular, the Global Index on Responsible AI found that
   universities and civil society organizations around the world are filling in critical
   gaps within their national AI ecosystems across a number of thematic areas, and
   particularly those that fall within the AI and Human Rights dimension.

   The Caribbean


   In the Caribbean, universities in Guyana and Jamaica are engaged in

   responsible AI, primarily through the development of ethical

   guidelines, training, and workshops, as well as international

   cooperation and public participation and awareness.

   North America 


   In the United States, the independent research institute Algorithmic

   Justice League published a report entitled “Bug Bounties for

   Algorithmic Harms? Lessons from cybersecurity vulnerability

   disclosure for algorithmic harms discovery, disclosure, and redress”.

   Drawing inspiration from cybersecurity methodologies, which

   involve compensating hackers for discovering and reporting system

   vulnerabilities to enhance security, the Algorithmic Justice League

   proposes a comparable approach for detecting bias and adverse

   effects stemming from AI systems. This report explores the

   potential application of the Bug Bounty model to address

   algorithmic harms, examining the Twitter Algorithmic Bias Bounty

   Challenge as a case study. It evaluates both the achievements and

   limitations of this initiative in identifying and mitigating bias,

   discrimination, and associated harms originating from AI systems.

   A Long Way To Go
   A major finding of the Global Index on Responsible AI is that the world has a long way to


   go to achieve responsible AI. Despite the global proliferation of the development and use


   of AI systems, the majority of countries around the world are far from adopting


   responsible AI. Sixty seven percent of the world's countries scored up to 25 points out of


   100 in the GIRAI and a further 25% between more than 25 and up to 50. This means that


   nearly 6 billion people across the world are living in countries that do not have adequate


   measures in place to protect or promote their human rights in the context of AI. 






   Some of the main areas of responsible AI which lag critically behind such as Gender


   Equality and Labor Protections and the Right to Work have been highlighted above. Other


   areas requiring attention include: Public Participation and Awareness, Public Sector Skills


   Development , Competition Authorities, and Children’s Rights.

A Long Way To Go


On a regional level, the African continent is where responsible AI needs the most support and
attention, followed by the Caribbean, Central and South America, Asia and Oceania and, to a lesser
extent, the Middle East. While this remains prescient, it is also important to note that in countries
where the adoption and use of AI is low, it is to be expected that AI governance is not a priority
area for governments.

Future Outlook
on Responsible AI
                                                                                       Future Outlook on Responsible AI




         Diverse Pathways to

         Responsible AI
           Responsible AI lags far behind the development and adoption of AI. There are major gaps
           across many parts of the world and many areas of responsible AI, particularly regarding
           human rights and AI. As a global community we have a long way to go. This finding is not
           altogether surprising given that responsible AI is an emerging field of governance. 



           To date, responsible AI practices have not adequately sought to address inequality and
           promote equitable outcomes. As responsible AI practices continue to develop around
           the world, regions need to work together to ensure that progress toward responsible AI
           includes everyone. 



           Despite the sobering picture the Global Index on Responsible AI paints on the global
           state of responsible AI, the bright spots highlighted in this report demonstrate that
           achieving responsible AI is possible in all contexts. 



           In addition, the strong commitment to international cooperation in responsible AI, and to
           working together across countries and regions to advance responsible AI globally is a
           hugely important foundation upon which to build a shared agenda on the global
           governance of AI and cooperation toward the eradication of the AI divide. 



           Recommendations



           A cross-representation of country scores across the different pillars of the Global Index
           on Responsible AI demonstrates that while there is a significant clustering of countries
           which score below 25 across all pillars and a smaller cluster of countries that perform
           well in all pillars, there is a significant diversity in the performance of countries in the
           different pillars that fall between the two clusters. What this indicates is that there are
           many pathways to achieving responsible AI. For example, while Japan scores fairly low on
           government frameworks, it scores highly on government actions. And while Slovenia
           scores high on government frameworks, its score for government actions is much lower.
           Yet both countries have similar scores overall. 



           Accordingly, countries need to examine their individual scores per pillar to assess areas
           for improvement. The recommendations set out below therefore provide some generally
           applicable areas for strengthening across the various levels of scores.

         What’s Next?
          This report constitutes a summary of the key findings from the global data collection
          undertaken as part of the First Edition of the Global Index on Responsible AI. All the data
          that was collected for the GIRAI is freely and openly available at: global-index.ai. Further
          reports containing data analysis and findings from the First Edition will be published online
          throughout 2024 and 2025. 


          It is hoped that researchers around the world will engage with the data of the Global Index
          on Responsible AI, opening new avenues for research and that the evidence will support
          advocacy agendas for groups seeking to champion responsible AI and AI and human rights
          in their respective countries and regions. Our regional partners will be leading some of this
          work in their respective regions: Derechos Digitales in Latin America, East West
          Management Institute in Asia and the Local Development Research Institute in Africa. If you
          are interested in working with us or with the data of the 1st Edition of the Global Index on
          Responsible AI, please contact us at hello@global-index.ai.
          Second Edition of the Global Index on Responsible AI


          Data collection for the Second Edition of the Global Index on Responsible AI will begin in
          September 2024, and the results will be published in early 2025. As new AI technologies are
          released, the GIRAI will need to adapt its methodology and conceptual framework to ensure
          it remains an appropriate multidimensional tool for understanding responsible AI use and
          practice around the world. In this regard, the Second Edition will include an assessment of
          how countries are responding to the challenges and opportunities of frontier technologies,
          such as generative AI. The Second Edition will also place more emphasis in understanding
          how countries around the world are addressing AI challenges and opportunities in relation
          to inequality. In particular, a thematic area on AI and persons with disabilities will be
          included to assess what countries are doing to ensure that AI respects the rights of
          persons with disabilities.
